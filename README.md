## Introduction 

I used to work as a mechanic / electrician until two years ago, having done so, I got a first hand experience of the problems caused by [Planned Obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) and the absence of [Right To Repair Laws](https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro). You may be surprised how often manufacturers refuse to sell spare parts, schematics, diagrams etc. even to certified technicians and repair shops, so I quickly developed a disdain for such practices.

I decided to take a deeper dive into electronics and pursue a degree in the field so I started preparing for University by studying at home. After some time I realised that I am mostly using **[Free]** **[Open Source]** or **[Open Hardware]** sources to study and practice, so I made an effort to get rid of all the paid and proprietary stuff altogether and start supporting the OS / OH projects and communities instead.

Apart from books, these communities and their projects taught and helped me the most, so I feel like it would be only fair, if I also share my work with others.

## Warning 

I am not yet a student or an engineer, nor do I pretend to be an expert. I started [this project](https://github.com/RavnaPCB/01.OSOH_SOM_MB) with the sole purpose to deepen my knowledge in electronics and learn PCB Design, so some mistakes, design flaws and thing I didn't think through are to be expected for now. I will be reporting every issue and potential problem I find in the repository's "Issues" tab.

I hope that one day, when everything is sorted out, people could use the project as a reference design or maybe even put the boards to actual use.

## Future Plans and Goals

> Get admitted to University :D

> Develop a series of robust [OpenHardware] Systems On Module [SOM], Motherboards and Single Board Computers [SBC] capable of operating in the industrial temperature range, accompanied by detailed circuit descriptions, spreadsheets, simulations and repair manuals.

> Only [OpenSource] software will be used, to demonstrate it's capabilities and show to people stil in doubt, that designing complex boards and project is possible without paying thousands for proprietary software.

    All your feedback, cirticism, help and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
